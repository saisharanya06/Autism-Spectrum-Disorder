 🧩Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 🧩
🚀 A Machine Learning-based Web App for Early ASD Detection

📌 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-powered web application developed using Python and Streamlit to assist in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It leverages multiple classification algorithms to predict ASD risk based on user inputs, making it accessible for both medical professionals and general users.

🔍 Features
✔ Real-time ASD Risk Prediction using ML models
✔ Interactive UI built with Streamlit
✔ Multiple Machine Learning Models:

Naïve Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
✔ Insightful Visualizations: Heatmaps, Feature Importance Graphs, ROC Curves
✔ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering for accuracy optimization
📂 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Streamlit
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ The user inputs relevant behavioral and medical data.
2️⃣ The system processes the data and applies ML models to assess ASD risk.
3️⃣ The prediction results and visual analytics are displayed on the web interface.
